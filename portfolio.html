        My Portfolio Project is a personal web-based portfolio designed to showcase my technical skills, academic projects, and achievements in a professional format. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, responsive design with sections like Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Each project is presented with visuals, summaries, and links to GitHub repositories. The site offers a smooth navigation experience and works across devices. It serves as a digital resume, helping recruiters and collaborators explore my work—including web apps, machine learning projects, and full-stack systems—in a single organized and interactive platform.
